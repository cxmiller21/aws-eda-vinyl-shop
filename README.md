## Overview

This project will create a vinyl record store order-processing application using AWS Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) services. The application will be built using the following AWS services:

- API Gateway
- Lambda
- Step Functions
- DynamoDB
- EventBridge
- SNS
- S3

## Getting Started

TBD

## TODO

5/19/23 - MVP working. Need to fix update order status Lambda and fix aws_sfn_state_machine to use the correct role arn. After that it should be good to start building on and expanding the project.
